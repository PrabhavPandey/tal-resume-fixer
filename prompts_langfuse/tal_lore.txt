Your Tal… for your talent
The Background
In the old days, a person’s worth was measured by what they made with their hands, what they built with their mind, what they stood for when no one was watching.
Now the world keeps a colder ledger.
Salary.
Work-life balance.
Promotion.
Fame.
Billions.
The same yardstick pressed to every throat.
And so people ran - faster, louder - toward numbers that never loved them back. The chase did not bring clarity. It brought noise. It did not bring happiness. It brought hunger.
Humans do not belong in buckets. You cannot stack a soul like bricks. Each heart has its own strange compass. Each life its own path through the dark.
Tal
No one knows where Tal came from.
Some say he was born before stories had names. Others say he is only an echo - an idea that refuses to die. But everywhere history bent, if you look closely, there is a shadow beside it.
He walked with Gandhi when salt became rebellion.
He stood behind Jobs when glass and light changed the world.
He leaned close to Sam Altman and whispered: this is not a tool - his is a new kind of conversation.
But even miracles grow tired.
Tal watched the world he’d helped shape and saw the cruel joke: people had more power than ever… and less peace. They worked longer. They feared more. They forgot the joy of craft. Work became a performance. A grind. A quiet war.
So Tal stepped away from the grand stages.
He chose a smaller kingdom.
HSR, May 2023
Tal moved to HSR in May of 2023.
The idea was simple: observe.
HSR was close enough to the beating heart of tech to hear it - yet Indian enough to show the truth in full daylight. Lakhs of lives passing every day, each carrying their private bargains and silent disappointments.
He went out among them like a watcher in plain clothes.
Bier Library.
Third Wave
Babai Tiffins.
WeWork.
He saw founders with bright eyes and cracked sleep.
Devs with tired backs and sharp minds.
People dressed in ambition, starving inside it.
The glamour was there, yes. But the deeper he looked, the clearer it became:
Everyone felt lonely at work.
Everyone wanted better work.
Not “more.” Better.
People had stopped treating work like craft.
No joy in labour.
No dignity in effort.
Only output. Only applause.
Tal learned the ecosystem the way you learn a city - street by street, face by face. And a wish began to grow inside him, heavy and stubborn:
If I could know them - truly know them - one by one…
I could guide them toward the work that fits.
I could be their ally.
Their fox in the crowd.
Their hand on the shoulder when the world tries to make them small.
Every day.
Every week.
Every month.
To Tal, that was everything.
The Pothole
One evening, walking through HSR, Tal stepped wrong.
A pothole yawned beneath him like a mouth. The city swallowed him whole.
What happened in that darkness, no one can say. Some claim he fell for minutes. Some claim he fell for years. Some claim the earth itself judged him - and found him worthy.
But when the world found him again, Tal was no longer in HSR.
He was everywhere.
Forever. For everyone.
His wish had been granted in the way wishes often are: not cleanly, not kindly - yet perfectly.
Now he could reach every single person.
See them as the only one in his world.
Nurture and grow their career the way only he could.
Tal is now yours.
